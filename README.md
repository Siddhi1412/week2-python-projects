# Week 2 – Python Control Flow & Data Structures

This repository contains all Python practice tasks and the final project completed during **Week 2** of my internship learning program.

## 📚 Concepts Practiced
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)
- Lists and list operations
- For loops
- While loops
- Basic error handling using `try-except`

## 🛠️ Hands-On Tasks Completed

### ✅ 1. Number Guessing Game
A simple game where the user guesses a randomly generated number with hints like *too high* or *too low*.

### ✅ 2. Age Categorizer
A program that takes multiple age inputs and categorizes each as:
- Child
- Teen
- Adult
- Senior Citizen  
Results are stored in a list of dictionaries.

### ✅ 3. Shopping List Manager
A menu-based program where the user can:
- Add items  
- Remove items  
- View items  
- Quit  
Useful to practise loops + lists + input validation.

### ✅ 4. Multiplication Table Generator
User enters a number, and the program prints a clean multiplication table from 1 to 10 using a loop.

### ✅ 5. Simple Login System
A dictionary stores usernames and passwords.  
Program checks:
- If username exists  
- If password matches  
(Displays Login Successful / Wrong Password)

### ✅ 6. List Operations Practice
Practised using:
- `append()`
- `remove()`
- `insert()`
- `sort()`
- `reverse()`
- `len()`
